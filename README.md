### Google Homepage Reconstruction Project

## Project Tasks:

- [x] Create github repository and use git to set up project
- [x] Deconstruct the Google search page using broswer developer tools, and then reconstruct it myself using HTML and CSS
- [x] Push page to github

## Project Source:

- From The Odin Project's [Web Development 101 Course](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

## Aim of Project:

- Consolidate knowledge from HTML and CSS tutorials and put them into practise
- Utilise git and github and get comfortable with their workflows
- Use browser developer tools to assist if needed

## Outcomes:

- Successfully reconstructed the Google homepage
- Much more comfortable using CSS (in particular grid and flex-box)
- Now comfortable with basic git and github workflow
- Now comfortable using broswer developer tools
- Probably spent too long trying to perfect the page
- Have a few things I'd still like to tidy up (e.g. code refactoring, perfecting the layout, improving mobile compatibility) - have added this as git hub issues
